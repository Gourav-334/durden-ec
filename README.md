## 1. Introduction

Greetings readers! I am **Gourav**, and started ***DEC*** (formly **Maltose**) as an open-source project with aim of creating an assembler having intuitive syntax for assembly programmers, now with plan to scale it as complete **source-to-memory** toolchain. Current focus is limited to **x86 processors**. I know it is not going to be made immediately or easily, which resonates with most of the quality engineering pieces. I have tried to keep the documents as descriptive & clear as possible. Still for any doubt, you can reach me out through the links given in the **7th** section.

All directories on this repositary have their own `README` file in `README ({path-to-dir}).md` format. This primarily explains the role of files & directories in that particular directory, which can help readers navigate easily through their desired focus area. While for parent/root directory, the information of its files & directories are mentioned in next section (**section 2**).


## 2. Features

- Intuitive syntax grammar
- Focused on portability
- Compatible with GCC & LLVM


## 3. System Requirements

- **<u>Processor</u>:** Intel/AMD (for now)
- **<u>Platform</u>:** Linux (any distro)
- **<u>RAM</u>:** ?
- **<u>Space</u>:** ?


## 4. Directory Structure

- `assets/` - Contains images, media & readable materials.
- `docs/` - Contains all the documentation.
- `misc/` - Contains miscellaneous files which aren't very important.
- `test/` - Contains each pilot run & unit test directory.
