# MALTOSE v0.1.0


## 1. Introduction

Greetings readers! I am **Gourav**, and started ***Maltose*** as an open-source project with aim of creating an assembler that has very intuitive syntax for assembly programmers, currently limited to **x86 processors** (upto **64-bit** architectures). I know it is not going to be made immediately or easily, which resonates with most of the good engineering pieces. Also I don't know how much useful viewers will find it or how many people will come to know about it, but I am really excited for getting this project done in right way. I have tried to keep the documents as descriptive & clear as possible. Still for any doubt, you can reach me out through the links given in the **6th** section.

All directories on this repositary have their own `README` file in `README ({path-to-dir}).md` format. This primarily explains the role of files & directories in that particular directory, which can help readers navigate easily through their desired focus area. While for parent/root directory, the information of its files & directories are mentioned in next section (**section 2**).


## 2. Features

- Intuitive syntax grammar
- Support for **x86** processors
- Inline **GAS** code
- Integration with **C** & **C++**


## 3. System Requirements

- **<u>Processor</u>:** Intel/AMD (atleast 8-bit)
- **<u>Platform</u>:** Linux (any distro) / Windows
- **<u>RAM</u>:** ?
- **<u>Space</u>:** ?


## 4. Directory Structure

- `assets/` - Contains images, media & readable materials.
- `docs/` - Contains all the documentation.
- `misc/` - Contains miscellaneous files which aren't very important.
