## **0. Areas Of Focus**

- Modularity
- Interoperability
- Command-line proficiency
- Adherence to principles


## **1. Core Philosophy**

- Write programs that do one thing & do it very well.
- Write programs to work together.
- Write programs to handle text streams.
- Keep it simple, stupid.
- Avoid adding functionalities until its really needed.
- Follow conventions instead of configurations
- Adhere to POSIX & open standards for portability & interoperability.


## **2. Development Practices**

- Proficiency with shell & command-line.
- Use text files for easy configuration. 
- Divide application into modular components.
- Use well-established standard libraries & system calls.
- Use make tools for automating compilation & linking.
- Use **Git** for version control, as its standard in community.
- Perform unit testing & integration testing.
- Automate tasks like testing with shell scripts.
- Write clear documentation with plain text formats.
- Write logs to `stdout`, `stderr` or in log files.
- Carefully handle errors with their return values.
- Be mindful of injection security & file permissions.
- Use system package manager for installation & maintenance.
- Access remote UNIX or UNIX-like systems with SSH.
- Implement proper process management.


## **3. Development Environments**

- Command-line editors like **Vim** are preferred.
- Even **IDEs** are good if having strong terminal integration.


## **4. Development For UNIX**

- Adhere to POSIX standards for maximum portability.
- Use ***Autoconf/Automake*** for creating portable build systems.
- Keep minimum platform-specific features with conditional macros.
- Thoroughly test applications on the platform(s).
