- **Security** (from stage 6,8)


## iii. Stages Summary

### 1. Standard Research:
- **1.1** Find research source.
- **1.2** Study the standards.
- **1.3** Write them down.
- **1.4** Make modifications.
- **1.5** Set rules & conventions.

### 2. Objectives:
- **2.1** Set objectives of the project.
- **2.2** Write what are common features.
- **2.3** Write what are unique features.

### 3. Required Tools Listing:
- **3.1** List the must required tools.
- **3.2** List the extra tools.

### 4. User Design:
- **4.1** Know the target audience.
- **4.2** Study other software in same category.
- **4.3** Design user friendly interface.

### 5. Component Distribution:
- **5.1** Make directory architecture.
- **5.2** Distribute work to libraries.
- **5.3** List possibly coming sub-components.
- **5.4** Serially arrange sequence of implementation.
- **5.5** Write rules for code structure.

### 6. Implementation:
- **6.1** Write sequential algorithms for a sub-component.
- **6.2** Make test cases.
- **6.3** Write the code with precautions.
- **6.4** Test & debug.
- **6.5** Map flowchart & eliminate overheads.
- **6.6** Repeat until all sub-components are covered.

### 7. Product Deployement:
- **7.1** Writing descriptive documentation journal.
- **7.2** Deployement with any well-known versioning system.

### 8. Feedback & Continuation:
- **8.1** Public polls to be released among users for feedback.
- **8.2** Point of repeating whole SDLC cycle.

>**<u>NOTE</u>:**
> - Implementation phase includes parallel version controlling.
> - VCS commits must have proper & descriptive commit message.
> - Documentation must be written with professional & respectful tone.
> - Documentation must also list used software with appropriate license copies.
